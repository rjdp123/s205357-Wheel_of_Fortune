    <string name="start_subheader">The rules are simple:</string>
    <string name="start_description_rules">1. A hidden word will be randomly picked from a category
        \n\n
        2. The job is now for you to guess it before you run out of lives
        \n\n
        3. You start with 5 lives and 0 points
        \n\n 4.
        Before each turn you spin the wheel of four outcomes:
        \n Get a life, lose a life, a number of points or losing all your points
        \n\n
        5. Is it a number you\'ll now be allowed to guess a letter
        \n\n
        6. You\'ll get the number of points for each instance if it\'s correct, otherwise you\'ll lose a life
        \n\n
        7. Once the word is fully visible you win. If, however, you run out of lives before this, you lose
        \n\n
